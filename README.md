# Survival-Analysis-Breast-Cancer-


My name is Leen Madani and I am a student enrolled in the Master of Biotechnology program (Digital Health Technologies stream) at the University of Toronto.

My repositories contain projects that I worked on throughout my master's year. If the project is done with teams, then this will be clearly indicated.

The projects are primarily relevant to data science in health, where I attempt to answer a research question through a thorough analysis of a dataset. The process involves data cleaning and the usage of a lot of statistical techniques (regression models, survival analysis, machine learning, classification, etc..).

If you have any questions, please email me at leen.madani@mail.utoronto.ca

**************

The objective of this project is to train and use a number of models for both regression and classification, as well as to perform survival analysis. You will use a data set from the University of Wisconsin where each record represents follow-up data for one breast cancer case after surgery.  The data set contains features computed from a digitized image of a fine needle aspirate (FNA) of a breast mass.  They describe characteristics of the cell nuclei present in the image. Information about the outcome of the patient is also included, such as time to recurrence or time to last seen, for those who have not experienced recurrence yet.
